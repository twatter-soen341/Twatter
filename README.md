# Twatter

## Let's start by listing what we are going to use MEAN stack:

* [MongoDB - NoSql Database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/getting-started/)
* [Express - framework for NodeJS to sweet things up](https://expressjs.com/en/guide/routing.html)
* [Angular - for the UI ](https://material.angular.io/)
* [Node.js ðŸ‘¹](https://nodejs.org/api/)


## Things we might need to further sweet things up
* [EJS - templating engine for html / maybe Angular already does that](https://ejs.co/)
* [Mongoose - sick mongoDB driver](https://mongoosejs.com/)
* [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists)
