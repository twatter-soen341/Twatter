1) Ranting platform. Connect and you can post what frustrates you. The post will be deleted within 24hrs automatically (Snapchat like)
2) Meme platform (Would need to be careful not to bust the 512MB of cloud storage)

3) Temporary tweets (like snapchat or instagram with stories)

4) matching feature ( based on interest, tweets content, etc we can match people or recommend them )
