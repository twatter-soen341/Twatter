Do a Pull request with 2 ideas on what the twatter system could be / do (don't forget to include your name)

### Etienne
1) Ranting platform. Connect and you can post what frustrates you. The post will be deleted within 24hrs automatically (Snapchat like)
2) Meme platform (Would need to be careful not to bust the 512MB of cloud storage)

### Tarek
3) Temporary tweets (like snapchat or instagram with stories)

4) matching feature ( based on interest, tweets content, etc we can match people or recommend them )

### Dean
5) Add a small window in the UI where we show some random ads
6) Add a small window where the local weather is shown
### Joanna
7) schedule tweets (post in 2 hours, post at 9pm)

### Alexandria (Sandy)
8) Have groups, limit access of a post. ie. "group1" can only see your posts. 

9) mini games?

### Paul
10) If we implement temporary twats, we can also implement temporary direct messages.
11) Twat of the day. We can have "likes" and "dislikes" then sort by controversial. 

### Narra
12) Night Mode (dark theme after 9pm, but can revert to regular theme)
13) Edit tweet after it has been posted
