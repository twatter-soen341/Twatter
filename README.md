## Description
A social platform for ranting about society. Users will see the most triggering posts around in order to get angry and have a bad rest of the day

## Core features:
### 1. Like / Dislike a tweet
   A user can like or dislike a tweet that he/she sees on her main twatter main page. The tweets are sorted with the most disliked posts on the top. In doing so, users dislike a post because they are angry or triggered. If they like the post, it means that it is soft and pale and not triggering enough.
### 2. Posting a tweet
   User will be able to post a 140 charachter tweet that can be read and liked by other profiles. All the users share on the same main twatter page.

### 3. A personal twatline
A user can have a personal page called twatline where he will see all of the tweets that he posted to the app.
