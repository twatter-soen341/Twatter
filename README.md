## Description
A social platform for ranting about society. Users will see the most triggering posts around in order to get angry and have a bad rest of the day

## Essential Definitions
* **Twatter** : Similar to Twitter in our project. Platform used to post _twats_.
* **Twat**: Similar to tweets/posts. It is a text post that others can comment on or like.
* **Twatline**: This is the page that displays the twats from your followers in latest order.
* **Profile**: Each user has a profile with information about their time on this platform.
* **TwatAge**: The time since the creation of the account (in seconds, days, months or years).
* **TwatScore**: The number of cumulative likes on your twats.

## Core features:
### 1. Like a tweet
   The system should allow an existing user to like a post from another user. The user will click a button and it will change the color to indicate that the user liked the post. The user should be able to like the posts from all Twatter community.
   
### 2. Posting a tweet
   User will be able to post content in the Website. More precisely they will be able to post a 140 character tweet that can be read and liked by other profiles. All the users share on the same main twatter page.

### 3. Follow a User
   The system should allow an existing user to follow another user. User A will click a button "follow" in the profile page of user B. User A will then be able to see all posts from user B in his timeline.

## Optional features:
### 1. Comment a post
   The system should allow an existing user to comment a post from another user. The user will click a button "comment "and it will allow him to write a text expressing his reaction/feelings to the post. This comment should be viewed by everyone that has access to the specific post.
   
### 2. Profile page
   The system should allow an existing user to have a profile page. This page would contain his tweets, name and username. The user should be able to update self-profile and check other users' profile.
